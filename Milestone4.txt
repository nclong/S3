Steps for loading game:

1. Open swordswordsword in Unity
2. Build tussle_server into an executable.
3. On computer 1, open that executable and note the IP
4. On computer 2, swordswordsword in Unity
5. Open the tussle_client scene. On the ClientObject object find the field "IP" and enter the IP from step 3
6. Build an executable out of the tussle_client scene
7. Repeat steps 4-6 but on a third computer.
8. As the client boots it will connect to the server


Esc in a client to disconnect
